## About

**Frenzy Bot** is a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot that treats users to an engaging message-based game in server channels. Prioritizing interactive gameplay, it maximizes user interaction as well as robust admin powers. Users get a chance to win by posting messages in a specific channel, with distinct game features such as cooldown management, spam detection, and admin-controllable option.

## Configuring the Bot

> Edit the Bot Token:

##  Using the Bot

- 1. Starting the Message Game: In the text channel where the bot is active, use the command to start a message game:
     ```python
     /start_message_game chance: <number> cooldown: <number> role: <role mention>
     ```
    
  - For example:
    ```python
    /start_message_game chance: 10 cooldown: 5 role: @Players
    ```
    
- 2. Ending the Game: Administrators can end the current game using:
     ```python
     /end_message_game
     ```

- 3. Managing Users: Administrators can ban or unban users from participating in the game with respective commands. For example:
     ```python
     /ban_user_from_message_game @user
     ```
     
     ```python
     /unban_user_from_message_game @user
     ```

- 4. Activating Frenzy Mode: To activate frenzy mode:
     ```python
     /start_frenzy length: <seconds> multiplier: <number>
     ```

     ```
